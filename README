Abstract

String::SetUTF8 lets you directly set or unset the UTF-8 flag for your 
strings. Sometimes you get binary data that Perl doesn't treat as UTF-8,
so instead of doing a trick with pack and unpack you can just use this 
module.

------------------
Basic Installation
------------------

String::SetUTF8 may be installed through the CPAN shell in
the usual manner.  Typically:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e 'install String::SetUTF8'

You can also read this README from the CPAN shell:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
  cpan> readme String::SetUTF8

And you can install the component from the CPAN prompt as well:

  cpan> install String::SetUTF8

-------------------
Manual Installation
-------------------

This module may also be installed manually.  Its distribution is
available from the author's CPAN directory,
<ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/A/AA/AAR/>, or a similarly
named directory at your favorite CPAN mirror.

Downloading and unpacking the distribution are left as exercises for
the reader.  To build and test it:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make test

When you're ready to install the component:

  make install

It should now be ready to use.

Thanks for reading!
